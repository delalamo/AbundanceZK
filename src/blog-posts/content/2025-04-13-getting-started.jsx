      <h2>Welcome!</h2>
      <p>This is the full content of the first blog post. It's written directly in HTML within a JavaScript string for simplicity in this example.</p>
      <p>Normally, you might write this in Markdown and then parse it into HTML using a library.</p>
      <p>You could include <strong>bold text</strong>, <em>italics</em>, lists:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Item 1</li>
        <li>Item 2</li>
      </ul>
      <p>And maybe even code snippets later!</p>
